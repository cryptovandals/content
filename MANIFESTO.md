# A CryptoVandals Manifesto


## 1. The gap between the physical world and the digital world is closing.

In the early days of the internet, you could make a distinction between the real world and digital world. We went by our handles, and spending time with internet people was considered weird.

Times have changed. We are living more and more of our lives on the internet. The argument that something isn't "real" because it only happens online doesn't carry much weight anymore.

## 2. Digital ownership is as important as physical ownership.

## 3. Digital ownership should give at least the same rights as physical ownership.

Digital ownership hasn't been real ownership. Its been based on licenses, which give fewer rights than physical ownership.

But digital ownership offers opportunities for new kinds of user rights that wouldn't make sense for physical ownership.
