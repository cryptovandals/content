# A CryptoVandals Manifesto

## 1. The gap between the physical world and the digital world is closing.
In the early days of the internet, there was a gap between IRL and URL. We went by our handles. If you spent real time with internet people, you were weird.
Times have changed. Now we live our lives on the internet. Social media has real name policies. We date internet strangers. The digital world has merged with the physical world. It's just the world.

## 2. Digital ownership is just as real as physical ownership.
Digital ownership didn't make much sense when anything could be copied. Media companies tried to stop copying with DRM and spyware. They failed.
Blockchains can change all that. They can make digital ownership real.

## 3. Digital ownership should give at least the same rights as physical ownership... maybe more.
Today's version of digital ownership isn't really ownership at all. Books, games, music, moviesâ€”digital content is licensed, not owned. The licensing agreements are typically very one-sided. The companies that offer content can change the rules arbitrarily or even take your content away. This isn't ownership.
What should digital ownership look like? As a baseline, digital ownership should give us the same rights we have over physical things. We should be able to have it, keep it, share it, or destroy it.
Digital ownership could even unlock new kinds of rights that wouldn't make sense for physical ownership. Digital ownership should make room for these new kinds of rights whenever possible.

## 4. CryptoVandals is about the right to creative destruction.
If you really own something, you can break it. You can smash it, cut it up, or burn it. More importantly, you can reassemble the parts into something new. That's the essence of CryptoVandals.
