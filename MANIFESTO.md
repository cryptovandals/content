# A CryptoVandals Manifesto


## 1. The gap between the physical world and the digital world is closing.

In the early days of the internet, you could make a distinction between the real world and digital world. We went by our handles, and spending time with internet people was considered weird.

Times have changed. We are living more and more of our lives on the internet. The argument that something isn't "real" because it only happens online doesn't carry much weight anymore.

## 2. Digital ownership is as real as physical ownership.

The idea of digital ownership didn't make much sense when anything could be copied. Media companies tried and failed to restrict copying with DRM and spyware, but copying persisted... until blockchains made digital ownership without licensing real.

## 3. Digital ownership should give at least the same rights as physical ownership.

Digital ownership hasn't been real ownership. It has been based on licenses. Typically, licenses gave fewer rights than physical ownership. They controlled what we could do with our stuff, or even let the real owners take our stuff away.

As a baseline, digital ownership should give us the same rights we have over physical things. We should be able to have it, keep it, share it, or destroy it. 

Digital ownership also offers opportunities for new kinds of user rights that wouldn't make sense for physical ownership. We should explore those new capabilities as well.
