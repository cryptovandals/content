# 🌎🏛CRYPTOVANDALS TERMS🏛🌏

## 🎪🎨WTF IS CRYPTOVANDALS🎨🎪
CryptoVandals is a website! It lets you vandalize ERC-721 NFTs you own. The original NFT is destroyed and you are issued a fancy new vandalized NFT.

## ©️🏴‍☠️INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY🏴‍☠️©️
You can only use CryptoVandals to vandalize NFTs you own. There may be copyrighted or trademarked stuff in your NFTs... but you own your NFT, right? Depending on the copyright law where you live, you might be allowed to create parodies or satirical works based on copyrighted works. Don’t violate copyright, citizen!

## 💰💸PROPERTY💸💰
You own your vandalized NFTs. You can do what you want with them, including selling them on the Opensea NFT marketplace. You can keep the proceeds of your sales, but if you want to donate a bit of ETH to us we wouldn’t complain.

## ⚰️💣WARNINGS💣⚰️
Using CryptoVandals will destroy your original NFT. We are not responsible for destroying your NFT or creating a new NFT, even if it all goes horribly wrong or if you destroy something you didn’t mean to or if the new token isn’t what you expect. 
If your original NFT was not compliant with ERC-721 or subject to its own terms, it may no longer work with the service it came from. Be careful!
You’ve been warned.

## 🔎🕵🏾‍♀️PRIVACY🕵🏻‍♂️🔎
CryptoVandals takes privacy super seriously! But unlike everyone else who says that, we mean it. 

## 🍪🌐WEBSITE PRIVACY🌐🍪
We don’t collect personal data or use any cookies on our website. You can use IPFS to access the site, or through the old traditional web. There may be some logs kept on Amazon AWS or Cloudflare if you use the boring old web version, but we won’t use those.

## 🔒🗝KEYS🗝🔓
CryptoVandals will never ask for your private keys. We use Metamask to view the NFTs in your wallet.

## 💾🔗ETHEREUM AND IPFS🔗💾
Anything you write to IPFS or the Ethereum blockchain will be there forever, or until the world ends, whichever comes sooner. We can’t do anything about that.
