# 🌎🏛 CRYPTOVANDALS TERMS 🏛🌏

## 🎪🎨 WTF IS CRYPTOVANDALS? 🎨🎪
CryptoVandals is a tool that lets you liberate or vandalize ERC-721 NFTs you own. The original NFT is burned and you are minted a fancy new liberated NFT or vandalized NFT linked to the original.
A **liberated NFT** has proprietary links and gateways replaced by open, accessible, and content addressed IPFS links.
A **vandalized NFT** is also liberated, but has the original linked content replaced by linked content of your choice.

## ©️🏴‍☠️ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 🏴‍☠️©️
You can only use CryptoVandals to liberate NFTs you own. There might be copyrighted or trademarked stuff in your NFTs... but you do own your NFT, right? Don’t violate copyright, citizen!

## 💰💸 PROPERTY 💸💰
You own your liberated NFTs. You can do whatever you want with them. If you sell it you can keep what you earn, but don't forget us when you're rich.

## ⚰️💣 WARNINGS 💣⚰️
Using CryptoVandals burns the original NFT by transferring it to a [null address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001). This can't be undone.
If your original NFT was not compliant with ERC-721 or if it was subject to its own terms, it may no longer work with the platform it came from. 
We aren't responsible for anything that goes wrong when you liberate or vandalize an NFT.
Be careful. You’ve been warned.

## 🔎🕵🏾‍♀️ PRIVACY 🕵🏻‍♂️🔎
CryptoVandals takes privacy super seriously! But unlike everyone else who says that, we mean it. 

## 🍪🌐 WEBSITE PRIVACY 🌐🍪
We don’t collect personal data or use any cookies on our website. There may be some logs somewhere, but we don't use them.

## 🔒🗝 KEYS 🗝🔓
CryptoVandals will never ask for your private keys. It uses Metamask to view, liberate, or vandalize the NFTs in your wallet.

## 💾🔗 ETHEREUM AND IPFS 🔗💾
Assume anything you write to IPFS or the Ethereum blockchain will be there forever, or until the world ends, whichever comes sooner. We can’t do anything about that.
